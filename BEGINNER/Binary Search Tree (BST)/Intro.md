### Introduction to trees :

* It is a kind of data structure.
* Linear data structures - Array, Linked list, stack, queue.

*  A logical tree generally starts with root and branches downwards. 

```py
*  A tree is a data structure which is used to store data when the data is somewhat heirarchical.
*  A tree is a collection of entity known as node connected in a heirarchical manner.
*  A tree is a non linear data structure.
*  The topmost node is called the root.
*  The data in tree is linked using parent and children nodes.
*  Siblings in trees have same parent.
*  A leaf is a node with no child.
*  Internal nodes are nodes which have atleast one child.
*  We also use terms like ascendant and descendant while using trees.
*  Cousins as the name suggests are nodes with diffn parents but same grandparent.
```

### Properties of Trees : 

* Recursive data structure : A tree has sub trees.
* 'N' nodes and 'N-1' edges.
* Depth of node = length of path from root to node. (depth of root is 0)
* Height of node = No. of edges in longest path from node to a leaf.
* `Binary Tree` - A tree in which each node has atmost 2 children.

### Applications of Trees : 

* Storing naturally heirarchical data : file system.
* Organize data for quick search addition and deleted : Binary Search Tree.
* Dictionary.
* Network Routing Algorithm.
