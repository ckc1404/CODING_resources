### Binary Tree :

Atmost 2 children.

* Perfect Binary Tree : Each node has exactly 2 children except the last ones. Maxm nodes : ( 2^(h+1) -1 ) 
* Strict or Proper Binary Tree : Each node has either 2 or 0 children.
* Height of a perfect binary tree with n nodes : log2(n+1)-1.
* Height of complete binary tree with n nodes : log2(n).

### Implementing Binary Tree 

* Dynamically created nodes.
* Arrays.
