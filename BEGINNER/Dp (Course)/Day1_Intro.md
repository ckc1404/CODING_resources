Day1

Most of the companies which come for placement and hiring do ask DP questions : nutanix, flipkart etc.

* How to identify if a question is a DP question ??

* There is an approach called `top to down approach`.
* We have a step in DP which requires tabulation which cannot be made in a single step.

* DP is nothing but enhanced `recursion`.
* `Recursion` - calling the same function with smaller inputs till it reaches base values.
* `Recursion` is the parent of `DP`.

IDENTIFY : 
  *  Recursive function
  *  Optimization

* We will always be given a choice in DP, like for example including a number or not. (`CHOICE`)
* If we have a choice, we can use recursion and if the cases overlap, we use Dp solution.
* By overlapping, it suggests that 1 func call in recursion --> No DP. 2 func call --> DP soln mostly.
* If optimal things are asked such as minimum, maximum, largest subarray etc.
* Steps for DP soln:
  * Recursive function
  * Memoize
  * Top to down DP

### Dp parent problems:

* 0-1 Knapsack
* Unbounded Knapsack
* Fibonacci
* LCS - Longest common subsequence
* LIS - Longest increasing subsequence
* kadane's algo
* Matrix chain multiplication
* Dp on trees
* Dp on grid
* Others
