### Knapsack problems

* Fractional knapsack --> Greedy.

* What is Knapsack !! 
* Knapsack is nothing but a bag. In such questions, we are given a bag with certain items like I1 I2 I3 etc.
* Let's suppose we have two arrays given : one for weight another for value of each item. 
* Then, we are given a W which is the capacity of our bag. 

```py
Ex:   i1 i2 i3 i4 
wt[] = 1  3  4  5
val[]= 1  4  5  7

W(capacity) = 7 lets say
